# BOILING-BAD
## about
tejasvini and i love doing silly things in college and we wanted a way to share this with people. so, boiling bad came to life.
the website serves to display our vlogs.

## libraries
we used ```Vite+React+Typescript``` for the website and ```gh-pages``` to deploy the website to github. this was particularly an interesting adventure because having to deal with massive videos and figuring out how to push them out and onto the site was interesting. i usually only put images on my sites as in my portfolio, but putting in videos proposed a unique challenge. 

this website was after my portfolio, so i added a lot of new changes that i hadn't put in last time, such as using ```module.css``` and organizing my code better. before i got started this time, i also ensured that i adequately planned the folders better. 

## more to add/issues
we are planning on adding more pages for some of our vlogs and addding more images. some of the images will not load, so i need to figure out how to fix that.
